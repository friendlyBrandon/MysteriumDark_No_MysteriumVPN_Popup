(Official Github Repository of MysteriumDark: https://github.com/mysteriumnetwork/mysterium-vpn-desktop )
I edited the Official version to stop showing the MysteriumVPN popup ads as they always appear while doing anything in MysteriumDark.

<br><br>
Enjoy!

To build it yourself from the source code, here are the commands:
<br><br>
1. Install and build the project
`yarn && yarn build`
<br><br>
2. Install Electron Builder (if not already installed)
`npm install --save-dev electron-builder`
<br><br>
IF you get the following error: 
`File C:\Program Files\nodejs\npm.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system.`
<br><br>
Please run that same command but in CMD.
<br><br>
3. Build the app
`npm run build`
<br><br>
<br><br>
That's it! Enjoy!
