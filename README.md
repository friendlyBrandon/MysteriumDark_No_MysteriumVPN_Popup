I am just going to cut to the chase, if you wish to go to the Official MysteriumDark repository here is the link: https://github.com/mysteriumnetwork/mysterium-vpn-desktop

I edited the Official version to stop showing the MysteriumVPN popup ads as they always appear while doing anything in MysteriumDark. Enjoy!


To build it yourself from the source code, here are the commands:

1. Install and build the project

yarn && yarn build

2. Install Electron Builder (if not already installed)

npm install --save-dev electron-builder

IF you get the following error:
`File C:\Program Files\nodejs\npm.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system.`

Please run that same command but in CMD.

3. Build the app

npm run build



That's it! Enjoy!
